# Detection and tracking of basketball players

This was a project that I did in the [Image Processing Systems](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en/fis/karton_predmeta/13E064SDOS-2019) class during my last year of undergraduate studies in the summer of 2021.

The goal was to use the image processing techniques to detect basketball players on the court and map their locations in order to reproduce their movement pattern during a game.

The detailed description of the process is, for now, available in Serbian as a .pdf document (in the form of an project report).
